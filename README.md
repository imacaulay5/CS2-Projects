# Knight Tour Project
This is my basic application of the Knight Tour problem using OOP
The objective is to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square exactly one time. You can choose the starting position of the knight and you can also choose the size of the board.
- selects the first valid move for the knight
- rarely makes full tours
